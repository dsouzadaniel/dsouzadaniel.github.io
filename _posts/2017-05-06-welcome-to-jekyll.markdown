If everything works fine, then this should be my first post. I have begun my github-pages journey in Jekyll (courtesy: Andrej Karpathy & <i>[his amazing blog](https://karpathy.github.io)</i> )

I am getting the hang of using Jekyll. Unfortunately for a really long time I had wordpress powering(<i>if you can say that</i>) all my projects. Jekyll although a tougher beast to initially set up, seems familiar. Almost too familiar.

Here are some of the reasons why I've moved to Jekyll :

1. I get to work on my `markdown` skills. If you don't know what that is, <i>[read this](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)</i>.
2. Get a little uncomfortable( Wordpress got me good.)
3. It's lighter.
4. Start that ML/Deep NLP blog I always wanted to get going(<i>& make it pretty.</i>)
5. Sounds waay cooler than Wordpress.
6. Why the hell not?

Also, it's pretty convenient to whip up pretty looking code for the web.

{% highlight python %}
from sklearn import linear_model
{% endhighlight %}

At this point, it should be pretty obvious that I am simply populating this post to see how far I remember my markdown tags.
<i>See you in the next one!</i>
